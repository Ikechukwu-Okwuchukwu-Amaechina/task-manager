# Task Manager

A beginner-friendly Node.js project for managing tasks. Use this as a starter to learn core Node.js concepts while building a simple task manager (add, list, update, delete tasks).

## Features

- Add new tasks
- List all tasks
- Update an existing task
- Delete tasks you no longer need


Note: This repository is a minimal Node.js starter. You can implement the features one by one as you learn.

## Installation & Usage

Prerequisites:
- Node.js (LTS is recommended). If you don’t have it, download from https://nodejs.org

1) Clone the repository

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Ikechukwu-Okwuchukwu-Amaechina/task-manager.git
cd task-manager
```

2) Install dependencies (none yet, but this keeps your workflow consistent)

```powershell
npm install
```

3) Run the app

The project uses `index.js` as the entry file. If it doesn’t exist yet, create it and start simple (e.g., log a message). Then run:

```powershell
node index.js
```



Then you can run:

```powershell
npm start
```
